# About me

Hello, I'm Stefan Wimmer, I'm a hobby programmer at the age of 19.

I started programming when I was 13 in 6th grade. Since then I learned numerous programming languages, including HTML - yes, I consider HTML a programming language -, PHP, JavaScript, Shell Script, Kotlin, Scala and Java.

For 2 years now I started to work with Node.js and NPM - or now Yarn - and even published some own packages like `webpack-promise` or `@stefanwimmer128/core`.
